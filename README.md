High level requirements:

- Use the http://fixer.io/ API to ingest currency rates.
- Have the ingest & store procedure run daily at 9:00AM.
- Ingest and store rates for all days *except* weekends.
- Ensure the system holds at least the last month of rates information.

Technical requrements:

- Write code as you normally would write for deployment to a production environment.
- Use Python version 3.6+.
- Provide instructions on how to install and run the application.
- Document (in a text/markdown file) how you could go about deploying & monitoring the application.
- If you ran out of time on any of the high level requirements, write down which you specifically did not yet implement.
